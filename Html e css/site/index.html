                    Foxes are small to medium-sized mammals that belong to the dog family, Canidae. 
                    They are known for their pointed ears, bushy tails, and clever behavior. 
                    The most common species is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which is found in many parts of the world,
                    including North America, Europe, Asia, and even parts of North Africa.

                    Foxes are highly adaptable animals. They can live in forests, mountains, grasslands, deserts, and even in cities.
                    They are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. 
                    Their diet includes small mammals, birds, insects, fruits, and vegetables.
